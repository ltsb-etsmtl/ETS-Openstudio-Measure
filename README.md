# Forced-air_brick_thermal_storage_measure
This repository contains an OpenStudio measure modelling the performance and control of a forced-air electric thermal storage device. 
The model is presented in the following article [article link to come] and further instructions are presented within the documentation attached to the measure.
This work has been developped as part of a graduate research project at the Ecole de technologie supérieure (ETS) with the support of Hydro-Québec.

The second measure, titled "remove_orphaned_object_from_IDF", is meant to be run before adding new thermal storage devices to the model to prevent fatal errors.
